Installation:
 Drag and drop the RemadeServicesByKilo folder into your fivepd/plugins folder.

This plugin **replaces** the default FivePD services! Currently there is no way to customize how this works, but that is something that I am currently working on!


This is an active work-in-progress, some features may break. If the peds get stuck and don't fix themselves, you can hold BACKSPACE.
